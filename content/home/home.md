# Welcome to Hillside Evangelical Church

Hillside Evangelical Church is a community church that has been meeting in the heart of Greystones for over 100 years.

We are seeking to explore and develop the reality of our Christian faith, not through a set of rules and procedures, but in a personal and real way, and bring the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ to our community and the world in a meaningful way.

We meet every Sunday morning for Morning Worship & Teaching, Oxygen Youth, Kids Club & Creche at 10.30am.

Within the service we usually have the following â€“ time of music and worship, bible study and teaching, shared Communion time, Oxygen Teens Club, Kids Club with age appropriate worship and teaching and Creche and playroom for toddlers.

We also run bible studies, small groups and other events regularly during the week, so come take a look!

Our church and facilities are fully wheelchair accessible.
