# Searching for answers about God
Jesus said “I am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.” Gospel of John chapter 14 verse 6

That’s a fairly dogmatic statement and we believe that if you’re going to understand the Christian faith you need to discover who Jesus is.

One starting point would be to read or re-read one of the gospel biographies from the New Testament.  You could start with any of them, but Mark was written earliest and is the shortest and Luke was written for non-religious people.  If you don’t have access to a Bible or a New Testament the following link will direct you to an online Bible.

We’re ordinary people from a variety of backgrounds who have discovered that Jesus is who He says He is – the Saviour of the world.  This good news we want to communicate to those around us.  We’ve included links to a number of tools which can help you think further about some of your questions or if your living in the Greystones area drop in some Sunday morning at 10.30 – directions on the sidebar to the right.

As Christians, we’ve discovered this most special treasure, and we know that there’s nothing in the world that we’d exchange it for. And, having found it, like someone who’s just discovered the cure for cancer, we know that at the very least, those we care for most have simply got to “get it”.

One of the main problems is that for so many, “religion” has been tried and tested, and failed. We are simply regarded as religious nuts or bible bashers…….”Joe’s found God!! Better stay out of his way”.
We know that this great news of the gospel is too important to hide, but how can we communicate it?

A number of ways we’ve found helpful are as follows:
- Alpha Course
  Alpha is a 10-week course that explores some of the basic truths of the Christian faith. Find out more here.

- Christianity Explored
  Christianity Explored, an informal course for people investigating Christianity, or brushing up on the basics. It explores who Jesus was, what His aims were, and what it means to follow Him. Find out more here.

- Gospel in a Day
  An informal discussion group session , with lunch, done in a home, involving chat on big “meaning of life” type issues, and including a presentation of the gospel, covering the main bible story from start to finish, in broad brush strokes.

As a way of encouraging people to think about important, but often avoided issues, we offer free CD copies of the humorous and thought provoking talk by John Ortberg, entitled “It All Goes Back in the Box”.

The way everyone can communicate this wonderful truth is simply by living in close contact with Christ, and allowing him to let his light and love shine through us.
It’s important that we properly understand the gospel because, just like we were before we received this precious gift, people are naturally skeptical, and usually have lots of valid questions and objections.

As the apostle Peter said, “When asked, always be ready to give the reason for the hope that is in you” (1 Peter 3:15). This is also known as Apologetics – the defence and the communication of the Christian faith. We’ve found a good resource that answers a lot of questions and helps explain the christian approach at www.bethinking.org.
