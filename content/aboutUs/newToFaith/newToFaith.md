# New to Faith
If you are new to the area or new to faith and are looking for a church family, please feel free to drop in some Sunday morning at 10.30 – directions on sidebar on the right.

Someone has helpfully said that “living things grow”. Growing in our faith happens both individually and as part of a community.  As well as Sunday mornings we have a variety of home groups were we can learn and grow together.  We are also hoping to organise an occasional **Foundations** course where we can work through our core beliefs so that those thinking of joining will better understand who we are and what we believe.

If you’re interested let us know and that may encourage us to get it organised!
