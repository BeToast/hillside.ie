# Teaching

## We teach from the Bible
Bible teaching and study is a core part of what we do when we meet on Sundays and in the various small groups.

Mostly we teach through various books of the Bible or on specific themes from scripture. We also look at issues and seek to understand how Biblical principles are relevant to how we make decisions and therefore how we should live.

## Our Biblical Belief
We believe that the entire bible is the inspired word of God and that men of God “were moved by the Holy Spirit” to write the very words of Scripture. As our doctrinal statement says we believe in “the divine inspiration and infallibility of Holy Scripture as originally given, and its supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct,” providing encouragement, guidance, comfort and instruction for training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21).

We believe that Christians grow in their relationship with God as we get to know him better through his word. To that end we want to see growing understanding as we are exposed to God’s word and the Holy Spirit brings ongoing transformation to our minds, our hearts and our behaviour.

We seek to provide a comprehensive programme of Bible teaching for children, teenagers and adults that enables us to keep growing through all of our lives. Our goal is a sure, firm grasp of the whole biblical revelation for every member. Such a grasp will enable us to address the changing values of our culture with steady truth and light.
