# Worship

## How we worship
“Make a joyful shout to the LORD, all you lands! Serve the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing. Know that the LORD, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all generations” (Psalm 100:1-5).

“With thankful hearts we sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God. Whatever you say or do should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, as you give thanks to God the Father because of Him.” (Colossians 3:16-18).

Our worship today is the way we live our lives every moment of the day. We please God by our obedience to His Spirit, as He leads us deeper into the truth of Jesus as found in the Bible. It is the heart attitude of the worshipper that matters to God.

Our praise and worship in hymns, songs and instrumental pieces of music reflects the glory of God taught to us in the Bible.

Our singing is an expression of our joy and excitement about God and what He has done for us. In our church service, music is used as an expression of corporate adoration of God, as well as the strengthening of the members of the church. In these times of worship, we do it together. We celebrate God’s goodness, we hear God’s Word, we pray for the world, we express our sense of community and we’re inspired to go out and live for God.

As Christians, we glorify God. We praise God because of who He is, and what He has done for us. We praise God because He is great and powerful. “For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised” (Psalm 96:4). “Be exalted, O LORD, in Your own strength! We will sing and praise Your power” (Psalm 21:13).
