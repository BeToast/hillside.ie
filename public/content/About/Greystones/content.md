Greystones is a coastal town in County Wicklow, approximately 18 miles south of Ireland’s capital Dublin.

It is a growing and thriving town, taking in neighbouring Delgany village and other surrounding areas, it has a population of approximately 18,000 residents. The town enjoys many good restaurants and shops catering for locals and tourists alike. Despite its size, Greystones retains its’ former village and community atmosphere.

Access to Greystones is very good. It’s just 3 miles from the main N11 route from Dublin to Rosslare and is on the main rail route south from Dublin to Wicklow, Arklow, Wexford and Rosslare. Greystones is also served by the Dublin Area Rapid Transit or “DART”, a fast and frequent commuter rail connection to Dublin. The town is also well linked to local areas, Bray and the Capital by bus.

Greystones boasts two beaches. The North Beach, running from Greystones harbour to Bray head, is a stoney beach backdropped by clay cliffs and Bray Head itself. The North Beach offers great views, quiet walks and excellent shore fishing. The South beach in contrast is a long sandy strip and is most popular with visitors. It has a much coveted “Blue Flag” status for its’ clean water and safe environment. Between the two beaches is a long wide rock outcrop from which the town derives its name.
