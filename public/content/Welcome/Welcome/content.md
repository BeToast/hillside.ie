# Welcome!

## Welcome to Hillside Evangelical Church

Hillside Evangelical Church is a community church that has been meeting in the heart of Greystones for over 100 years.

We are seeking to explore and develop the reality of our Christian faith, not through a set of rules and procedures, but in a personal and real way, and bring the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ to our community and the world in a meaningful way.

We meet every Sunday morning for Morning Worship & Teaching, Oxygen Youth, Kids Club & Creche at 10.30am.
Within the service we usually have the following: 
- Time of music and worship
- Bible study and teaching
- Shared Communion time
- Oxygen for teenagers in secondary school (roughly from 12-16)
- Kids Club with age appropriate worship and teaching
- Creche and playroom for toddlers  

We also run bible studies, small groups and other events regularly during the week, so come take a look!

Our church and facilities are fully wheelchair accessible.

Our church is on Hillside Road, which is the road opposite the Boots store on the Greystones Main Street as you are coming from the Bray direction. Turn right onto Hillside Road at this point and drive up a hundred yards and you will see our church on the right hand side.

## New to Faith?
If you are new to the area or new to faith and are looking for a church family, please feel free to drop in some Sunday morning at 10.30 – directions on sidebar on the right.

Someone has helpfully said that “living things grow”. Growing in our faith happens both individually and as part of a community.  As well as Sunday mornings we have a variety of home groups were we can learn and grow together.  We are also hoping to organise an occasional **Foundations** course where we can work through our core beliefs so that those thinking of joining will better understand who we are and what we believe.

If you’re interested in joining a **Foundations** course, let us know and that may encourage us to get it organised!

## Searching for answers about God?
Jesus said “I am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.” Gospel of John chapter 14 verse 6

That’s a fairly dogmatic statement and we believe that if you’re going to understand the Christian faith you need to discover who Jesus is.

One starting point would be to read or re-read one of the gospel biographies from the New Testament.  You could start with any of them, but Mark was written earliest and is the shortest and Luke was written for non-religious people.  If you don’t have access to a Bible or a New Testament the following link will direct you to an online Bible.

We’re ordinary people from a variety of backgrounds who have discovered that Jesus is who He says He is – the Saviour of the world.  This good news we want to communicate to those around us.  We’ve included links to a number of tools which can help you think further about some of your questions or if your living in the Greystones area drop in some Sunday morning at 10.30 – directions on the sidebar to the right.

As Christians, we’ve discovered this most special treasure, and we know that there’s nothing in the world that we’d exchange it for. And, having found it, like someone who’s just discovered the cure for cancer, we know that at the very least, those we care for most have simply got to “get it”.

One of the main problems is that for so many, “religion” has been tried and tested, and failed. We are simply regarded as religious nuts or bible bashers…….”Joe’s found God!! Better stay out of his way”.
We know that this great news of the gospel is too important to hide, but how can we communicate it?

A number of ways we’ve found helpful are as follows:
- Alpha Course
  Alpha is a 10-week course that explores some of the basic truths of the Christian faith. Find out more here.

- Christianity Explored
  Christianity Explored, an informal course for people investigating Christianity, or brushing up on the basics. It explores who Jesus was, what His aims were, and what it means to follow Him. Find out more here.

- Gospel in a Day
  An informal discussion group session , with lunch, done in a home, involving chat on big “meaning of life” type issues, and including a presentation of the gospel, covering the main bible story from start to finish, in broad brush strokes.

As a way of encouraging people to think about important, but often avoided issues, we offer free CD copies of the humorous and thought provoking talk by John Ortberg, entitled “It All Goes Back in the Box”.

The way everyone can communicate this wonderful truth is simply by living in close contact with Christ, and allowing him to let his light and love shine through us.
It’s important that we properly understand the gospel because, just like we were before we received this precious gift, people are naturally skeptical, and usually have lots of valid questions and objections.

As the apostle Peter said, “When asked, always be ready to give the reason for the hope that is in you” (1 Peter 3:15). This is also known as Apologetics – the defence and the communication of the Christian faith. We’ve found a good resource that answers a lot of questions and helps explain the christian approach at www.bethinking.org.
