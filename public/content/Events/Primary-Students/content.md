# Primary Students

## Kid’s Sunday Club
Sunday Club is offered for primary school children during the school term. Our kids attend the first part of the Sunday worship service with their families and then go out with their teachers to Sunday Club. We then break into our class/age groups (under 5’s, 5-7, and 8-11 years old) to learn from the bible.

There is also a supervised crèche programme, with lots of toys and games available for the very young.
On the last Sunday of every month we hold a special All Ages Service, where the format changes from month to month. Everyone gets to stay in for the whole service and participate. There is no Sunday Club on these Sundays, although crèche is still available.

In Sunday Club we look at the life of Jesus, the letters of the apostles, Old Testament characters and writings. Right now we’re learning about the book of Acts in the New Testament of the Bible.
We are seeking to teach children about the love God has for each one of them, a love that is demonstrated in the sending of his son Jesus. We want to help prepare their hearts and minds so that they can:

- know Jesus Christ
- learn from God
- live boldly for him
- learn all the amazing stories and miracles that happened in the bible
- learn to to use their bible to find answers to issues in their lives
- build friendships with other christian children
- have fun!
We use the “The Good Book” bible based children’s resource material – *Click*, and at the moment we are using some of the following programmes;

## *Click* (for under 5s)

Colouring, Stories, Crafts and much more….
Children under 5 are bubbling with life; everything is new, exciting and just waiting to be discovered. They are in the busiest time of their lives when they will learn more than at any other time and, crucially, when their brains establish learning pathways. They are receptive to God, to hearing him in ways that many of us have lost as we have grown up, and to having the sort of faith that Jesus wants us all to have.

## *Click* (for 5-7 year olds)
Children aged 5 to 7 love to play together, be creative, use their energy, explore new ideas and enjoy old favourites. They have a great capacity for friendship and empathy for anyone in trouble. They can have a depth of spirituality which can be both matter of fact and breathtaking. The Click material helps encourage our 5 to 8s in their daily lives with God.

## *Click* (for 8 to 11 year olds)
Children aged 8 to 11 like to have fun! They like to be with their friends and are growing increasingly independent. Most still like the opportunity to play games and to be creative, but they will shy away from anything that feels too babyish. Their capacity to learn is enormous and most can read quite well. We want to feed their imaginations and allow them space to ask the questions about the things that younger children take for granted. We want to encourage our 8 to 11s to live their daily lives for God.

As in all loving families, one of our priorities is to make sure each child is well cared for and safe. In compliance with our Safe Church Policy, church school teachers and other children/youth ministry volunteers have all been Garda vetted and have completed a Children’s Safety First course. We also require at least two adults to be in each classroom when children are present.
