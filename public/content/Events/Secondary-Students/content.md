# Secondary Students

## Oxygen Youth Club
Oxygen is our youth group for secondary school age teenagers. We meet during the Sunday service every first and third Sunday to engage on topics that are relevant to teens and Christianity. Whether you have decided to believe in the truth of the bible and Jesus Christ as our Savior or still have lots of questions about it’s validity and truth, we would love to see and hear you at Oxygen.

Our team leaders are all Garda vetted and have skills and experience with the challenges of being a Christian in the current age!

Apart from Sunday’s meeting, we host bible study groups during school terms for 1st and 2nd years on Monday evenings and 3rd years and up on Tuesday evenings. There are regular social events and these are often coordinated with other local Christian churches in Greystones and surrounding areas. We have very good relationships with these churches.

We seek to give our teens the knowledge and tools to make their own decision about the Christian faith. We respect all views and value everyone as we are all created in the image of our Lord.
