# Home Groups
We need others to help us learn and grow. Good relationships are foundational to life together as church. We believe in building community through caring and supportive relationships found in a home group.
Therefore our vision is to see every person, connected to a healthy home group, where we can encourage genuine friendship, ask questions, study scripture and develop meaningful and honest prayer and support for each other.

Home groups meet on Mondays (Youth), Tuesdays (Youth) and Wednesday evenings.
