# Sunday

## Every Sunday at 10:30am  
Within the service we usually have the following:  
- Time of music and worship
- Bible study and teaching
- Shared Communion time
- Oxygen for teenagers in secondary school (roughly from 12-16)
- Kids Club with age appropriate worship and teaching
- Creche and playroom for toddlers  

We hold our family service on the last Sunday of each month and it is a more open format.
