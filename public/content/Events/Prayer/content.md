# Prayer

## Prayer & Intercession

Prayer expresses our dependence on God and while none of us spend enough time praying we are committed to corporate prayer during our services, in small groups and in various informal settings as we give thanks and praise to God for who He is and what He has done.  We also spend time praying for the specific needs of members of our local church family as well as community, country and global issues.
