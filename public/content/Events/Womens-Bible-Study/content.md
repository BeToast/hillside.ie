# Womenâ€™s Bible Study

## About Women's Bible Study
This group is for women looking for an in depth study of scripture and an opportunity to connect with other women. It is a directed, discussional Bible study in a casual, friendly environment of 10-20 women.

Sometimes there is a little bit of homework and the bible study lasts approximately one hour plus time for coffee and prayer together. The group is open to **all women**, and we meet on a Thursday morning either in one of our houses or in the church.
