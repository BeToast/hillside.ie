In the first instance, your complaint will be dealt with by our Pastor, who will aim to resolve the issue or forward it to the leadership team (Charity Trustees) to respond. Please give us as much information as possible and let us know how you would like us to communicate with you, providing relevant contact details. If you are not satisfied with the initial response you may write to the Charity Trustees directly asking for the matter to be considered again.
