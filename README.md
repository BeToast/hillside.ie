## A re-design of [http://hillside.ie/]([url](http://hillside.ie/)http://hillside.ie/)
Currently, this is a side project to become completly fluent in Next.js and Tailwindcss  
Eventually, I will donate this project to Hillside Evangelical Church, Greystones.

I am creating a solution which reads md files to create the page content. I have added my own specifiers for images to signal the genPage() function to add images to the page.   
The directory structure is used with [generateStaticParams()]([url](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params)https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) to generate the pages and routes at build time.  
  
In the future, I will provide websites to churches at a fair price. Alot of church websites are desperate for modernization.
